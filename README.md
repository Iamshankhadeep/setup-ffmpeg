# setup-ffmpeg

Setup FFmpeg in GitHub Actions to use `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`. The action will download, cache and
add to `PATH` a recent FFmpeg build for the current os.

# Usage

To use `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, run the action before them.

```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: Iamshankhadeep/setup-ffmpeg@v1-beta
    with:
      # Not strictly necessary, but it may prevent rate limit
      # errors especially on GitHub-hosted macos machines.
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    id: setup-ffmpeg
  - run: ffmpeg -i input.avi output.mkv
```

This action also sets a few outputs:

- `path`: Path to the install directory
- `ffmpeg-path`: Path to the ffmpeg executable
- `ffprobe-path`: Path to the ffprobe executable

# FFmpeg Version

The action uses a recent FFmpeg build provided by the following sources:

- Linux Builds - https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/
- Windows Builds - https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
- MacOS Builds - https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/

**Note:** This action only supports x64 operating systems.
